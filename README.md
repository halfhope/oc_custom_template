## Management

#### Modifiers

Be careful with modifiers. The use of modifiers affects the content of the replaced tpl / twig files. If you want the new files to be similar to the ones you replace, you need to add support for the new files to the modifiers.

For example, we want to replace the product.twig file with product_showcase.twig. To do this, you need to find all the modifiers that make changes to the product.twig file and add product_showcase.twig support to them.

The list of modifiers that change a particular file and make the necessary changes can be viewed using my "Modification editor" script.
